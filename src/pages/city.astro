        <h1>Forsaken City</h1>
        <p>Forsaken City is another great introduction to playing Celeste without sight. It is much longer and more involved than Prologue but can still be beaten with
            mostly normalized strats while leaving room for more advanced and less consistent strats.

    <Room title="Room 1" num="1" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>Upon landing, do 2 URD as fast as possible. 
            On the second, hold grab and up to climb up the wall. Upon landing, do a hyper to the right and hold grab. 
            Be sure to let go of down to not fall down. Upon landing, do a jump followed by a URD.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 2" num="2" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>
            In the transition, you can safely spam RD while holding grab to get to the spring. Climb up until you hit the spring.
            Wait a brief period (~0.5s) before doing a RD. The timing window here is pretty big so you should not have too much trouble with this RD.
            Upon landing, do a full jump and then a RD to get to wall. To get out, you can UD, followed by 3 full jumps. 
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 3" num="3" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>
            In the transition, you can safely spam a URD to get to the second platform while holding grab. Hold up to climb up the wall.
            Upon landing, do a hyper to get to the third platform while holding grab. Hold up to climb up the wall. Upon landing, do a URD
            and climb out of the room.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 4" num="4" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>
            To reach the wall faster, you can time a UD followed by holding right and grab. A safer strat is to wait until you hear the wood landing sound before
            doing a full jump, followed by a UD, followed by holding right and grab. Hold up to climb up the wall. 
            Upon landing, do a ND to get on the moving platform. After the end of the sound cue of the moving platform, do a LUD while holding grab.
            Climb up to get out of the room.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 5" num="5" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>In the transition, you can safely spam DRD to lodge yourself into the corner. Climb up the platform. Upon landing, do a full jump, followed by a URD while holding grab.
            Upon grabbing the wall, hold up until you hear no more sound cues. Do a neutral followed by holding right and grab (as you would in a normal any%). Hold up to climb up.
            Upon landing, do a RD and UD to get out of the room.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 6" num="6" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>In the transition, you can safely spam DRD to lodge yourself into the corner. Climb up the platform. Upon landing, do a full jump, followed by a URD while holding grab.
            Upon grabbing the wall, hold up until you hear no more sound cues. Do a full jump to the right while holding grab. Again climb up until you hear no more sound cues.
            Again do a full jump to the right while holding grab. Climb up until you hear Madaeline land. Upon landing, do a hyper to the right while holding grab. 
            Upon grabbing the wall, hold up and right. Upon hearing the sound cue of the spring, UD and hold up, right, and grab to climb out of the room.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 7" num="7" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>Climb up until you hear no more sound cues. Do a full jump to the left and lodge yourself into the corner. Do a full dash jump to right while holding grab.
            Upon hitting the crystal, climb up until you hear no more sounds cues. Full jump to the right and URD to get over the spikes. You can safely spam a URD followed by 
            holding right and grab.
        </p>
    </Room>
    <Room title="Room 8" num="8" chapter={chapter}>
        <p>Upon hearing the metal sound, climb up until you hear no more sound cues. Hold right, let go of grab, and quickly re-grab. Upon hearing the metal sound, RD as lightly 
            as possible (i.e. tap right as light as possible). Upon landing, do a full jump to the right immediately followed by a UD and holding grab and right.
            Do a full jump to the right and URD as soon as you hear the sound cue of the crystal. Upon landing, do another URD to get over the hump. Upon landing, do LDs to
            lodge yourself into the corner. Do a full hyper into the next room while keeping left and down held.
